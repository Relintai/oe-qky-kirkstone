attempted to bump rust from 1.59 to 1.65, but python3-cryptography has
failed:

| copying src/cryptography/hazmat/bindings/_rust/x509.pyi -> build/lib.linux-x86_64-3.10/cryptography/hazmat/bindings/_rust
| running build_ext
| running build_rust
| warning: build_rust: Forced Rust target `x86_64-poky-linux` is not compatible with deduced Rust target `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` - the built package  may not import successfully once installed.
| 
| error: Error loading target specification: Could not find specification for target "x86_64-poky-linux". Run `rustc --print target-list` for a list of built-in targets

1.65 is supposed to support rust for the target, but oe-core master has
not yet got all the bugs out. staying with 1.59 in kirkstone.
